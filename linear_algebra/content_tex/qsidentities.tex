Monoid & Set with Addition defined.\cr
Group & Set with Addition and Subtraction.  Group Operator may not be commutative.\cr
Abelian Group & Set with Addition and Subtraction.  Group Operator must be commutative.\cr
Ring & Abelian group plus Multiplication.\cr
Field & Ring plus division. In other words, set with 0,1, and all four primitive operations. \cr
Vector Space & Set $V$ over {\bf F} with addition and scalar multiplication\cr
Subspace & A subset $U$ of $V$ is called a subspace of $V$ if $U$ is also a vector space.\cr
Sum of subsets & $U_1,...,U_m\subset V$. Then the sum of $U_1,...,U_m$ is the set of all possible sums of elements of $U_1,...,U_m$ .\cr
Self-adjoint & $=$ Hermitian $=> A=A^\dagger$ \cr
Unitary & $=> AA^\dagger=A^\dagger A=I$ \cr
Injective & $=$One-to-one. No two elements in range map to same element in domain. \cr
Surjective & $=$Onto. A function $T : V \to W$ is called surjective if its range equals W. \cr
o-t-o corr. & One-to-one correspondence means injective and surjective. \cr
